# Information for RefinedRust developers

## Setup
You will need to install some specific dependencies in order to have a development setup of this project.

There are two maintained ways to do this, using `nix` or (`opam` and `rustup`).

Both methods require you to have a local copy of this project.

### Setup using `nix` flakes
We assume that you have `nix` installed on your system. Setup instructions can be found here: https://nixos.org/download

To setup the project for development purposes, you can use `nix develop` to enter an interactive subshell containing the tools you will need:
```bash
cd <refinedrust-root-project>
nix develop
```

The tools lives in this subshell and will disappear as soon as you leave the subshell.

If you do not have flakes enabled, you may get this error:
```
error: experimental Nix feature 'nix-command' is disabled; use ''â€“extra-experimental-features nix-command' to override
```

All you have to do is enable flakes, see this [NixOS wiki page](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes) for more details on how to enable flakes permanently.

### Setup using `opam` and `rustup`
By following the procedure in the `README.md`, you should have the required setup for development.

## Editor configuration for working on the frontend
To work comfortably on the frontend, it is recommended to use `rust-analyzer`, which provides nice features to your editor like code completion.

If you are using `nix develop`, the following command must be run each time the toolchain is updated due [to a bug inside `cargo`](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/10096):
```bash
sudo unshare -m bash -c "mount -o remount,rw /nix/store; cargo metadata --format-version 1 --manifest-path ${RUST_SRC_PATH}"
```

Furthermore, it is required that `rust-analyzer.rustc.source` points to the value of `${RUST_SRC_PATH}`:
```bash
echo ${RUST_SRC_PATH}  # Keep this path, you will need it.
```

The remaining configuration depends on your editor.

### Emacs
For Emacs, you need to install the [LSP Mode plugin](https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/page/installation/).

After installation, you need to configure the property `rust-analyzer.rust.source` to point out the location of the source of `rust-analyzer` (`RUST_SRC_PATH`).

This property has to be set in your configuration, and can be temporarily set by using:
```
<M-x> set-variable, choose `lsp-rust-analyzer-rustc-source` and replace by "<the path given by ${RUST_SRC_PATH}>"
<M-x> lsp-restart-workspace
```

Please remember to update this value each time the rust toolchain is updated.

### Vim
For Vim, [`YouCompleteMe`](https://github.com/ycm-core/YouCompleteMe) has good support for Rust using `rust-analyzer`.
Look at its README for instructions on configuring keybinds.

However, by default, it ships its own `rustc` toolchain and sources which are used for completion and which are not updated frequently
(this is apparently due to `rust-analyzer` having a very unstable API; see https://github.com/ycm-core/YouCompleteMe/issues/4012).
This creates problems, because YCM will constantly rebuild the project with its own toolchain (and the build cache will conflict with `cargo build` in the toolchain RefinedRust uses, so it needs to do full rebuilds),
and you won't get proper autocompletion of `rustc` internals.

To work around this, the `_vimrc_local.vim` file shipped in this project sets the right toolchain (if you have installed `https://github.com/LucHermitte/local_vimrc`), by setting:
```
let g:ycm_rust_toolchain_root = '/home/[user]/.rustup/toolchains/[current-toolchain]'
```
You just have to change the `[user]` to match your setup (sadly, references to `home` by `~/` or `$HOME/` do not seem to be supported), and `[current-toolchain]` to the current version of the RefinedRust toolchain declared in `rust-toolchain.toml`.

To set the `rustc` sources, setup a `.ycm_extra_conf.py` file (for setting it globally, add e.g.
```
let g:ycm_global_ycm_extra_conf = "~/.vim/.ycm_extra_conf.py"
```
to your `.vimrc`) and put the following into it, putting the right path to a checkout of https://github.com/rust-lang/rust):
```
def Settings(**kwargs):
  if kwargs['language'] == 'rust':
    return {
      'ls': {
        "rustcSource" : "/home/[...]/rust-git/Cargo.toml",
      }
    }
```
(if you already set other options, add just the `rustcSource` config).

### Visual Studio Code
For Visual Studio Code, you need to install the [rust-analyzer extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust-analyzer).

After installation, you need to configure the property `rust-analyzer.rust.source` to point out the location of the source of `rust-analyzer` (`RUST_SRC_PATH`).

This property has to be set inside the `settings.json` file of your user (not the workspace):
```json
{
    "rust-analyzer.rustc.source": "<the path given by ${RUST_SRC_PATH}>"
}
```

Please remember to update this value each time the rust toolchain is updated, by repeating the same steps.

## Updating dependencies

### Updating the frontend's rustc version
1. Update the file `rust-toolchain.toml` in `rr_frontend` to the new desired nightly version.
2. Make the required changes for `nix` (see below).
3. Try to get the frontend building again.

### Updating `nix` dependencies
The project is described with `nix` using the file `flake.nix`, containing a list of `inputs` and `outputs`.

#### Updating `nix` inputs
The `inputs` set contains some repositories (`fenix`, `nixpkgs`, ...) that describe how to build dependencies.

In order to be reproducible, this `inputs` set is locked to a specific version
using the file `flake.lock`.

To update this set, you can use `nix flake update` and commit the modified `flake.lock` file.

#### Updating `nix` outputs
The `outputs` set describe the project, including how to build some external dependencies.

Those dependencies are described using a couple:
 - `version`/`sha256` for `coq`, such as `stdpp`, `iris` or `lambda-rust`, and;
 - `dir`/`sha256` for specifying the `rust` toolchain.

To update a dependency:
1. Replace the `sha256` string with the empty string `""`.
2. For a `coq` dependency, replace the `version` string with the desired `git` commit hash.
3. Run `nix build` and wait for the error that throws the hash mismatch.
4. Replace the `sha256` empty string with the hash from the received error.
