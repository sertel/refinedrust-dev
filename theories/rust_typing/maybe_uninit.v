  (* reading/writing:
     does this need special handling?

     We certainly need some handling for read/write rules to inject into maybe_uninit when necessary, esp. below arrays.
  *)
  (* TODO: add these rules *)


  (** borrowing rules: *)
  (* for now, just don't allow borrowing maybe_uninit directly and handle it specially.
     TODO: in future, have an annotation for borrowing that enforces invariants. *)
  (* TODO: add the override *)



End rules.



  (*
     What happens with borrowing?
     - if it is Some, I want to create a borrow for the whole thing.
        To do that, I will probably need a place rule that just makes a maybeuninit into the inner type for the place access, and in the continuation wraps it again.
     - what happens with the blocked then? I cannot wrap a blocked directly in this type.
       In principle, this is fine from the perspective of the mutref contract, because the borrow enforces that I actually get a T back, so it is fine to put a Some there.
       Should I just bubble the blocked up (i.e. use openedltype/coreable)?
       In principle I know that I will get a maybe_uninit T back after the borrow ends, so this is fine intuitively. The only diff is how the ghost resolution does stuff. (NOTE: here ghost resolution would need to descend below the maybeuninit. But I have the right infrastructure for that, we just need to add a ghost_resolve instance for ◁ (maybe_uninit T)
       So I guess the place instance will just work via openedltype.
   *)

  (*
     How will the write of an initialized element to a maybeuninit location look?
     - in principle, if we can write strongly, just write. OpenedLtype closing should later apply the subtyping rule for injection into maybe_uninit.

     - for an array_ltype, subtyping should work elementwise. The openedltype in that case will require to go to an array where every field has the same type. Afterwards, that can be folded to an array_type again.


     TODO one thing to think about: we can't do refinement type updates for array_ltype, so we need to do the injection already at time of writing.
     How should writing work?
      - have: current type of place (ltype), type of value to write
      - options for rules we can use:
        + do a strong write, just put in the current value at its type.
        + do a strong write, but just put in a value_t for the written value and assemble ownership later on when needed.
        + directly adapt the type via subtyping so they match
      - we can also combine the options:
        + have specific instances (high priority) for particular combinations of types, and use one of the other options as default if they don't match.
          -> already doing that currently for writing to a mutltype etc.
          -> for maybe_uninit: have two specific instances for writing to it.
        + and then, as a fallback: just do a strong write (or decide based on the type change).

   *)

  (* Issue for borrowing:
     if we borrow a maybe_uninit T but really need a T, we need to know that and commit to it ahead of time (when borrowing) because of restricted subtyping.
     Solutions:
     - actually do a reborrow when subtyping, since the refinement gives us enough information
        then there's a lot of stuff happening there. it also needs later credits. so this gets quite fragile.
     - can we do the previous thing without reborrowing? could this ability be directly built into mut refs?
        in principle, stuff like this that is enabled by the refinements should be more natural.
        Point is: our refinement model is too inflexible. we need more leverage to say that the other case (None) is vacuous because of refinement info.
          - this is not quite true, because the lender will still expect the maybe_uninit back, not the full thing.
            in a sense, this case is really similar to the [u8; 2] ≈ u16 case. It's basically equivalent according to the intuitive notion of subtyping (taking into account the refinement) but it doesn't hold in our model.
     - have custom rules and just say that we generally borrow the T instead of the maybe_uninit when the refinement says so.
        this makes it a bit less flexible, but it's probably fine. the annoying part is that we have to duplicate the borrowing logic a bit.
     => TODO which of these makes most sense?
